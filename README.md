# FestiSounds_Backend  🎶

FestiSounds is more than just an app. It's a bridge that connects you to the world of undiscovered music, one festival at a time.

We believe that every artist, no matter how small or unheard, carries a unique sound that deserves to be shared and celebrated. And we believe that every music lover, like you, should have the chance to experience the thrill of discovering your new favorite artist.

## Our Mission  🚀

Our mission is to enhance your festival experience by introducing you to up-and-coming artists who are ready to take the stage. Whether you're planning your festival itinerary or looking for a new sound to accompany your daily routine, FestiSounds is here to help you connect with artists that move and inspire you.

## Supporting Artists  🎤

But FestiSounds isn't just about music discovery. It's about supporting artists who are just starting to make their mark on the world. When you use FestiSounds, you're not just finding new music; you're helping lesser-known artists connect with audiences they might not have reached otherwise.

## Join the Journey  🌍

FestiSounds is your ticket to a world of music waiting to be explored. Let's set out on this journey together, one festival at a time.
